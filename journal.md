It has now been 4 weeks of code school (one third of the way there!! Woooo!), and another 2 weeks since I wrote a journal entry. I am feeling really good with HTML and CSS and feeling even better at JavaScript (in particular with the DOM manipulation and the class OOP). I am looking forward to React and other frameworks to see how they can make our steps easier. I know it will be another whole thing to conquer, but I am quite excited about the prospect. I am greatly looking forward to seeing how I like the backend of things as that is completely new to me. I am ready to keep it going!
